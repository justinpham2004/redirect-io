One of my favorite C project's I did in school for my Computer Systems class. 
This program acts like a testing system for student code, compiling that code, 
and testing the code with given tests. 

This was done with concepts unique to C. I used concepts such as dynamic memory allocation,
process creation using fork(), process execution and replacement using execvp, and command line i/o.

I found this project interesting because it gave me a very low-level understanding of the components 
which make up a program.

This was my favorite project, which is why I chose to upload it to Github!
